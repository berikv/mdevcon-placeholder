===================

Mdevcon Site placeholder. At the very first mdevcon, before we had a site, we had this placeholder up as a teaser:

http://mdevcon.com/placeholder/

It's still featured on today's website, in the 'it's about what's under the hood' in the top right corner of the mdevcon website.

See http://mdevcon.com for information about the mdevcon conference, by and for mobile developers.
